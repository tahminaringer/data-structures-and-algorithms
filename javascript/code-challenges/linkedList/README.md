# Singly Linked List (code challenge 5 and 6)

- Created a linked list and tests

## Challenge

### Create a Node class-

#### Challenge 5

- By Tahmina Ringer

1. Method of insert adds a new value to the head of the list
2. Method of Includes takes in a value and returns a boolean it exist or not
3. Method toString returns a string of all the values in the linked list

**Input:** value, no argument
**Output:** Boolean, string of values
**Big** 0 = O(1), O(n)

#### Challenge 6

By: Tahmina Ringer, Jeremy Penning, Ashley Moore

1. Method of append that adds a new node with a value to the end of the node list
2. Method of insertBefore finds a value in the LL and adds a new value before the found value
3. Method of insertAfter finds a value in the LL and adds a new value after the found value

**Input:** any value, an existing value in the linked list
**Output:** new value appended to the end of the list, new value inserted into the LL before or after the found existing value
**Big** 0 = O(1), O(n)

#### Challenge 7

By: Tahmina Ringer, Mariko Alvarado

1. Method for the linked list class that takes in K as a parameter and return the node's value that  has the index of K

**Input:**  linked list
**Output:**  value of the index of K
**Big** 0 = O(1), O(n)

## Aproach & Efficiency

My approach was to start with the code and then write the tests.

## API

- **Challenge 5**
  - insert- to add a new node
  - includes- to search for existing node
  - toString- to return a string of all the nodes

- **Challenge 6**
  - append - add new node to LL tail
  - insertBefore- find existing value and insert node before  existing value
  - insertAfter- find existing value and insert node after  existing value

- **Challenge 7**
  - Write a method that takes a number as a parameter and returns the LL index of that number starting at the LL tail

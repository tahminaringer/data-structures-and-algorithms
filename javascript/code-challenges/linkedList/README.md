# Singly Linked List (labs 5 and 6)

- By Tahmina Ringer, Jeremy Penning, Ashley Moore
- Created a linked list and tests

## Challenge

### Create a Node class-

1. Method of insert adds a new value to the head of the list
2. Method of Includes takes in a value and returns a boolean it exist or not
3. Method toString returns a string of all the values in the linked list
4. Method of append that adds a new node with a value to the end of the node list
5. Method of insertBefore finds a value in the LL and adds a new value before the found value
6. Method of insertAfter finds a value in the LL and adds a new value after the found value

Input: value, no argument
Output: Boolean, string of values, new value appended to the end of the list, new value inserted into the LL before or after the found existing value

## Aproach & Efficiency

My approach was to start with the code and then write the tests.

Big 0 = O(1), O(n)

## API

- insert- to add a new node
- includes- to search for existing node
- toString- to return a string of all the nodes
- append - add new node to LL tail
- insertBefore- find existing value and insert node before existing value
- insertAfter- find existing value and insert node after existing value

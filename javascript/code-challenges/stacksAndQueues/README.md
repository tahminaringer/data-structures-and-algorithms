# Stacks And Queues

Create a stack that can push one or more elements into the stack, pop one or more elements from the stack, peek at the top element in the stack, check if the stack is empty and throw errors.

Create a queue that enqueue one or multiple elements into a queue, dequeue one or more elements in a queue peak at the front item in the queue, and check if the queue is empty.

Provide testing to test above measures

# Tree Intersection

## Code Challenge 32

Authors: Tahmina Ringer, Jeremy Penning, & Ashley Moore

- Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary tree parameters.

- Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return a set of values found in both trees.

- The output array can only have unique numbers

- INPUT: Two Binary Trees
- OUTPUT:  Common Values in each tree

### Big O

- Space -O(1)
- Time -O(n)

### Edge Cases

- If no numbers match
- There is nothing in the the tree

## Approach & Efficiency

I wrote my code first and then wrote tests to validate the code.

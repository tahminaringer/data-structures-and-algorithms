# Fizz Buzz Tree

## Code Challenge 18

- Author Tahmina Ringer

## Challenge

- Write a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a k-ary tree as an argument.
- Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both.
- Create a new tree with the same structure as the original, but the values modified as follows:
  - If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
  - If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
  - If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
  - If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.

## Approach & Efficiency

I drew my whiteboard first, then wrote my code.

## Big O

worst case - O(log n)
best case - O(height)
Space - O(1)

## Testing

Write tests to prove the following functionality:

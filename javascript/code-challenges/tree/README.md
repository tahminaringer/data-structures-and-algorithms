# Binary Trees

1. Created a Node class, a Binary Search Tree Class with an extended class of BinaryTrees. Created methods for preOrder, InOrder and post Order for a binary tree. As well as included add() and contains() methods for the binary search tree class. Add() method adds node in order and contains() method searched for a specific node

2. Wrote an instance called findMaximumValue that returns the maximum value stored in the Binary Tree without using any built-in javascript methods

## Challenge

Learning how Binary Trees work.

## Approach & Efficiency

I wrote my code first and then wrote tests to validate the code.

## Big O

worst case - O(log n)
best case - O(height)
Space - O(1)

## Testing

Write tests to prove the following functionality:

### Challenge 15 testing

- Can successfully instantiate a new node
- Can successfully instantiate an empty Binary Search Tree
- Can successfully instantiate a tree with a single root node
- Can successfully add a left child and right child to a single root node
- Can successfully returns null on BinaryTree methods if called on an empty tree
- Can successfully return a collection from a preorder traversal
- Can successfully return a collection from an inorder traversal
- Can successfully return a collection from a postorder traversal
- Can successfully returns true when running contains() on good value
- Can successfully returns false when running contains() on bad value

### Challenge 16 Testing

- Can successfully return a maxValue from a Binary Tree

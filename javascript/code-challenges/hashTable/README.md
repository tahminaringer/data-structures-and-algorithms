- Created a hash table using single-responsibility principlewith a Node class, LinkedList,and implimented methods for add, get, contains and hash.

## Approach & Efficiency

I wrote my code first and then wrote tests to validate the code.

## Big O

Time - O(n)
Space - O(1)

## Testing

Write tests to prove the following functionality:

### Challenge 30 testing

- Adding a key/value to your hashtable results in the value being in the data structure
- Retrieving based on a key returns the value stored
- Successfully returns null for a key that does not exist in the hashtable
- Successfully handle a collision within the hashtable
- Successfully retrieve a value from a bucket within the hashtable that has a collision
- Successfully hash a key to an in-range value

# Binary Trees

## Challenge 15

Authors: Tahmina Ringer, Ashley Moore and Garrett Citron

- Implemented a Graph structure that is represented as an adjacency list, and includes methods `addNode()`, `addEdge()`, `getNodes()`, `getNeighbors()` and `size()`. 

## Approach & Efficiency

I wrote my code first and then wrote tests to validate the code.

## Big O

worst case - O(n)
Space - O(n)

## Testing

Write tests to prove the following functionality:

### Challenge 35 testing

- Node can be successfully added to the graph
- An edge can be successfully added to the graph
- A collection of all nodes can be properly retrieved from the graph
- All appropriate neighbors can be retrieved from the graph
- Neighbors are returned with the weight between nodes included
- The proper size is returned, representing the number of nodes in the graph
- A graph with only one node and edge can be properly returned
- An empty graph properly returns null
